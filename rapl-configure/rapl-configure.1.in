.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) configures \fIpower limits\fP on
hardware that are respected on average over a \fItime window\fP.
An Intel\*R Sandy Bridge (2nd generation Intel\*R Core) or newer processor is
required.
Users are expected to have some familiarity with RAPL before using this tool.
Refer to the "Intel\*R 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manual,
Volume 3: System Programming Guide" for more technical information.
This description is only a short summary.
.LP
Power limits are configured on a per-socket basis, although most client systems
only have a single processor socket.
Each socket supports \fIzones\fP, also known as \fIdomains\fP, to manage power
at fine-grained levels.
Hardware components other than the processor can sometimes also be configured
as zones.
Currently supported zones are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\fIPackage\fP: a processor package, including cores and other shared resources
like the uncore components below and a DRAM controller.
.IP \[bu]
\fICore\fP: the processor core, like compute components and private caches
(often L1 and L2).
Core is also known as \fIPP0\fP, or Power Plane 0.
.IP \[bu]
\fIUncore\fP: non-core processor components like shared/last-level caches
(often L3) and any integrated graphics hardware.
Uncore is also known as \fIPP1\fP, or Power Plane 1, and is typically only
available on client processors like those for desktops and laptops.
.IP \[bu]
\fIDRAM\fP: directly-attached main memory.
DRAM power capping is typically only available on server systems, but has been
spotted on some client hardware.
.IP \[bu]
\fIPSys\fP: the entire platform/system.
PSys is a known as \fIPlatform\fP, is only available on Intel\*R Skylake (6th
generation Intel\*R Core) and newer processors, and requires additional BIOS
support.
.LP
RAPL hardware enforces that the average power over a time window does not
violate the configured limit.
Package and PSys zones support two power limits, or \fIconstraints\fP - \fIlong
term\fP and \fIshort term\fP.
Other zones support a single constraint (long term).
.LP
Actual power limit and time window values are system-dependent.
Refer to your hardware's technical documentation, particularly for the Thermal
Design Power (TDP).
.LP
By default, rapl\-configure\-@RAPL_LIB@ uses the PACKAGE zone on socket 0.
Current values are printed if no flags, or only socket and/or zone flags, are
specified.
Otherwise, specified values are set while other values remain unmodified.
When setting values, zones are automatically enabled unless \-e/\-\-enabled is
explicitly set to 0.

.SH "REMARKS"
.LP
Administrative (root) privileges are usually needed to access RAPL settings.
.LP
Not all zones are supported by all systems.
Some systems may not allow configuring or enabling/disabling supported zones,
even if they expose the configurations.
.LP
Power and time window values are not always stored exactly as specified.
This is a result of how values are encoded in the Model-Specific Registers.
When using the powercap backend, some accuracy may also be lost as the
interface forces rounding values to microJoule and microsecond precision.
